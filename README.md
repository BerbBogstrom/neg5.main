Neg 5 is a web application written by a quiz bowler to help other quiz bowl tournament moderators and directors run their tournaments in a collaborative manner and eliminate some of the common problems they run into at every event. A potentially unlimited number of staffers are able to work together to enter team information, game information, and handle team registration all in one application. For more information about what it can and to give it a try, check out [neg5.org](http://neg5.org)
